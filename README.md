# Candour

**A trust layer between consumers and products.**

Candour shows what real people on Reddit are saying about a product — raw, unfiltered, no marketing, no fake reviews.

If Reddit hates it, you should know before you buy.

## Why Candor Exists

Product reviews are broken.  
Influencers are paid.  
“Verified” doesn’t mean honest.

Reddit is the only place where people accidentally tell the truth.

Candour makes that truth searchable.

## Tech (MVP Stack)

- Frontend: React Vite, Tailwind, Framer motion
- Backend: Node.js

## Vision

Before you buy anything, you should see what Reddit thinks.

Candour makes that default.
